 ### Restart Again

- npm install
- npm start

- How you can write code in much better way

### Single Responsibility Principle
- if you have a class/function/identity that should have a single responsibility
- If you have restaurantMenu its only job need to be show menu
- Maintain the code modular format so that it is more testable/maintable
- Features like Reusability, Maintainable, Testable
- Hook is just a utility function

### Custom Hooks
- This helps in Single responsibility principle
- This is are not mandatory things
- It is not mandatory to write use at the starting for custom hooks 

### Chunking (Code Spliting)
- Dynamic Bundling, Lazy loading, on demand loading, Dynamic import 
- All the written components are kept in one JS file at the end 
- As the Components increases the single JS file size increases 
- So we need to split the code 

### Lazy Loading
- Is used to make the webpage load only when we are in that page
- Use Suspence with it to for fallback
