# JSX

JSX is a js syntax which is easier to react elements
jsx doesnt belong to react (they both are not same)
it is not html inside js it is "html like or XML like syntax"

js is a code that js engine understands it
js engine doesnt understand jsx code
because js engine understands ecma/es6 script

const jsxheading = <h1 id="heading">Heading using JSX ðŸš€</h1>
this will be given error when you place it inside console
as it cant understand it as it not pure valid js

Then how is the code working : Parcel is doing the job behind the scences
Even before the code goes to js engine it gets transpiled
then transfered so that JS Engine can understand

# Babel

Parcel can able to do this using a thing called "BABEL"
Babel is JS Compiler and helps in converting JSX to ReactElement
Babel makes browsers understand JSX code and even make understandle for older browsers

If you want to write JSX in multiple lines then add () to JSX code to know start and end of JSX
if its single line it is not required
